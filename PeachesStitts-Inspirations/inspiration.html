  <p>I created this mock-up poster for my design class this past spring. I chose Janet Jackson’s Rhythm Nation album because I find it electrifying, progressive, and powerful in its message. The album addresses themes of social injustice, unity, and empowerment—topics that are still deeply relevant today. I felt that Rhythm Nation was the perfect choice to reflect the current social and political climate, and I wanted my design to honor both its message and impact. This is a mockup of a poster I made in my design class.</p>

<p>I'm inspired by Prince because he was open-minded and unafraid to speak the truth. He was innovative, honest, and undeniably charismatic. His music has motivated and touched countless people, leaving a lasting impact on generations. </p>
