  <p>I created this mock-up poster for my design class this past spring. I chose Janet Jackson’s Rhythm Nation album because I find it electrifying, progressive, and powerful in its message. The album addresses themes of social injustice, unity, and empowerment—topics that are still deeply relevant today. I felt that Rhythm Nation was the perfect choice to reflect the current social and political climate, and I wanted my design to honor both its message and impact. This is a mockup of a poster I made in my design class.</p>

        I'm inspired by Janet Jackson because she stands firmly against injustice while maintaining a remarkable career
        and a humble, grounded personality. As a music icon, she has delivered powerful messages through her songs,
        addressing social issues, self-worth, and empowerment—especially with albums like Rhythm Nation 1814, which
        became
        a cultural milestone for its bold stance on racism, poverty, and education. Her music blends pop, R&B, and dance
        with meaningful lyrics that have resonated across generations. In addition to her musical achievements, Janet
        has
        built a successful acting career, starring in films like Poetic Justice, where she portrayed a strong, complex
        female lead navigating grief, love, and resilience. Her ability to balance fame with humility, and to use her
        platform to speak out on important issues, makes her an enduring inspiration to many.

    <h2>Prince</h2>

      <img class="float-right w-60 ml-4 mb-2" src="./img/prince-pictures-rtfebmuher88o4jd.png" alt="Prince" />
      <p>
        I'm inspired by Prince because he was open-minded, unapologetically authentic, and unafraid to speak the truth—both in his art and in his life. As a musical genius and boundary-pushing visionary, he revolutionized the music industry with his eclectic style, genre-defying sound, and fearless experimentation. From funk and rock to soul and electronic, Prince created his own sonic universe, blending influences with unmatched originality and flair. His performances were magnetic, his lyrics deeply expressive, and his ability to channel raw emotion through music set him apart as one of the most influential artists of all time.

But Prince's influence extended far beyond music. He was a trailblazer for artistic freedom, using his platform to challenge the exploitative practices of the recording industry. His bold decision to change his name to an unpronounceable symbol was a protest against contractual restrictions that robbed artists of their creative control and intellectual property. In doing so, he ignited a larger conversation about ownership, rights, and the importance of integrity in the creative process—issues that remain relevant today.

Prince was also a quiet but powerful force for social change. Though he rarely sought the spotlight for his philanthropic efforts, he consistently gave back to communities in need, supporting initiatives focused on education, technology access, youth empowerment, and social justice. He funded programs to bridge economic divides, particularly in underserved Black communities, and mentored young artists behind the scenes to ensure the next generation had the support and freedom to thrive.

His legacy is a testament to the transformative power of creativity, courage, and compassion. Prince taught the world that true artistry isn’t just about making music—it’s about standing up for what you believe in, staying true to yourself, and using your voice to uplift others. His influence continues to ripple across generations, inspiring creatives, activists, and dreamers to lead with purpose, passion, and power.
