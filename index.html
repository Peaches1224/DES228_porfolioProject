          <h2>I'm Peaches</h2>

          <p class="mb-[30px] px-[20px] indent-5 ">
           Born and raised in San Francisco, I am deeply inspired by the city's creativity and innovation. My journey began in high-end salons and cosmetology, where I spent over a decade perfecting the art of connection, design, and attention to detail. This foundation propelled me to transition into the tech and marketing world, where I’ve discovered a passion for building and creating in new ways.
<p class="mb-[30px] px-[20px] indent-5">
My philosophy is rooted in the belief that aesthetics and functionality can transform experiences, whether in beauty, design, or technology. I specialize in web development and digital marketing, with expertise in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, React, WordPress, and tools like Git and GitHub. Beyond the code, I thrive on collaboration, working seamlessly across time zones, and adapting to every challenge with enthusiasm and positivity.
</p>
<p class="mb-[30px] px-[20px] indent-5">
I also bring a strong creative edge, honed through my skills in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and After Effects, and a keen eye for detail that ensures every project shines. My mission is to combine technical expertise with thoughtful design to create meaningful and impactful solutions.

I love connecting with others, exchanging ideas, and learning from every interaction. If you’re looking for someone who combines passion, creativity, and dedication, I’d be thrilled to contribute to your organization. Please feel free to reach out—I’m always open to conversations and opportunities to collaborate!
